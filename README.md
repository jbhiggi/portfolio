# Jack Higginson ‚Äì Project Portfolio

Hi, I‚Äôm Jack ‚Äî an astrophysics PhD student exploring applications of advanced statistical and ML techniques to both astrophysics and financial markets.

This is a top-level repo that summarizes my Astrophysics and Quantative Finance repos.

## üíπ Quantative Finance
- [tau Trader](https://github.com/jbhiggi/tauTrader): LSTM-based Deep Neural Network trading signal pipeline with cross-validation threshold mapping for precision optimization
- [Strategy Surface Stability Analysis](https://github.com/jbhiggi/Strategy-Surface-Stability-Analysis): Backtesting framework to study robustness of strategy parameters via Jaccard similarity, centroid drift, entropy, and heatmap visualizations.
- [Predicting Stock Prices with Fourier Transforms](https://github.com/jbhiggi/Predicting-Stock-Prices-with-Fourier-Transforms): signal‚Äëprocessing approach to short‚Äëterm stock price forecasting using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)

## ü™ê Astrophysics Projects
- [Catalogue Completeness Package](https://github.com/jbhiggi/Completeness-Correction-for-Quasar-Spectra.git)
- [Automated doublet search](coming soon)

- [CONTRIBUTOR - rbvfit](https://github.com/rongmon/rbvfit): A Bayesian Voigt profile fitter. Optimized for absorption line analysis.
