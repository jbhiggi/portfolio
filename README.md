# Jack Higginson – Project Portfolio


Hi, I’m Jack — an astrophysics PhD student exploring applications of advanced statistical and ML techniques to both astrophysics and financial markets.

This is a top-level repo that summarizes my Astrophysics and Quantative Finance repos.


## 🪐 Astrophysics Projects
- [Catalogue Completeness Package](https://github.com/jbhiggi/Completeness-Correction-for-Quasar-Spectra.git)
- [Automated doublet search](coming soon)

## 💹 Quantative Finance
- [Strategy Surface Stability Analysis](https://github.com/jbhiggi/Strategy-Surface-Stability-Analysis): Backtesting framework to study robustness of strategy parameters via Jaccard similarity, centroid drift, entropy, and heatmap visualizations.
- [Predicting Stock Prices with Fourier Transforms](https://github.com/jbhiggi/Predicting-Stock-Prices-with-Fourier-Transforms): signal‑processing approach to short‑term stock price forecasting using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)
